I'm just as surprised as you are. From inspiring spirituality in the workplace to full-stack software developer. I want a position where I can continue the journey of crafting software - astonishing myself and others with what is possible. I'm happiest as part of a team working toward a common goal. I value the people I collaborate with every day as much as the type of product we're creating together.
