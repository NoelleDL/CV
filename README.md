From inspiring spirituality in the workplace to full-stack software developer. I want a position where I can continue the journey of crafting software - astonishing myself and others with what is possible. I'm happiest as part of a team working toward a common goal. I value the people I collaborate with every day as much as the type of product we're creating together.

## Skills

#### Leadership

* While a **student** at Makers Academy, I was a mentor for two incoming Makers students which included pair programming during the pre-course and co-led a group for female cohort members.
* In the role of **Web Assistant**, I led a production team of three for a video messaging product aimed at policy makers on Capitol Hill, including coordinating production schedule and editing content.

#### Problem-Solving

* During the **Acebook** project at Makers Academy, our team initially struggled and didn't know where to begin. I implemented daily retros and stand-ups to facilitate communication and identify a path forward. In the end, we produced an [amazing product](https://github.com/NoelleDL/acebook-Underdogs).
* As the **Mission Integration Program Coordinator**, I was hired to revitalize a cherished yet lifeless awards program. I identified areas for improvement including creating an automated submission resulting in a 200% increase in awards submission.
